Isabella
Ah, so that’s where Mr. Bunbun went.

[Isabella approaches the rabbit plushie on the bridge.]

Isabella
Don’t go running off. I haven’t repaired all of these bridges yet.
Are you upset? I’m sorry I can’t bake carrot cake like Dianna…
I miss her too, but…
…
Oh no, you have a tear in your leg! Poor thing! I have to fix you!
I left sewing kit over there…

[Isabella walks right and finds that the bridge has collapsed.]

Isabella
	I guess this part collapsed.
	More work for later today…
	It’ll be faster to make a new sewing set at the cathedral instead.

[Isabella walks left and finds the entrance blocked by a statue.]

Isabella
	Why is there a new Mr. Boulder?
Step aside.

Mr. Boulder
	No can do, Isabella.
Even if Master Dianna is no longer with us, I will continue to resist you. 
	

Isabella
I have to fix something… move.

Mr. Boulder 
There’s so little left in the cathedral.
You need to stop.

Isabella
	But there’s something I have to fix…

[Dialogue ends there. If the player tries again to enter, Mr. Boulder rotates through the following lines]

Mr. Boulder
Not everything needs to be fixed.
Do you not feel ashamed of yourself?
I thought you were Dianna’s friend…

[Isabella can retrieve a broken chunk of rock at the right side of the map and return to smash the statue.]

[Entering the cathedral should alter the lighting to a dreary dark color.]
Isabella
	Who keeps repairing Mr. Boulder…?
	How are you getting in my way still, Dianna?

[Fade to black]
